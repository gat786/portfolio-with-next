# Github Browser

Github Browser is a Windows Desktop Application built with Project Reunion
Components. It is also a POC made to be demoed to showcase benefits of
building with Project Reunion instead of normal Windows UWP SDK or traditional
Windows XAML.

It uses Github API to fetch list of Github Repositories and enables you to
search through the repositories to something that you might like and then read
Repositories through the Markdown Renderer inside the application itself.

As it was a Native Application it used very less resources and without any
repositories loaded it used to run under 25 megabytes of ram usage which
I think was commendable when you take into consideration that it ran with the
latest and greatest widgets of Windows.

At the point of writing this blog the application has not been released in
public and there are only limited screenshots that I can share with the people
reading this space and I have included them below.
