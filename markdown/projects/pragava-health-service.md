# Pragava Health Services

This is a Web Application built to enable telemedicine with help of Azure
Communication Services. It is heavily inspired from Contoso Med App and
relies on Azure Communication Services as well as many other integrations
such as Microsoft Azure Active Directory for management of doctor and manager
accounts.

It enabled features such as discovery of doctors in the vicinity on based of
their speciality and ratings that was garnered through users themselves. Using
Pragava Patients can book online, in-person and doctor-visits for medication.

It also enabled patients to be in constant contact of doctors using chat
feature without actually having to share contacts with doctors or hospitals.

It was built using ReactJs, JavaScript and ReduxJs for State-Management of the
application. TailwindCSS was introduced in this application for the first
time for me and I had a great time building the application with the help of
it.

I learnt how to use colors with TailwindCSS and customize colors with the 
help of `tailwind.config.js`
