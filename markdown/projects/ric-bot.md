# Ric-Bot

Ric-Bot is a Discord bot named after my beloved friend 
[Ricardo Prins](https://github.com/ricardoprins). This was built to facilitate 
our servers at [Tesseract Coding](https://github.com/TesseractCoding) and 
help out for managing servers. The Bot does very simple things like always
stay active and look for every message if they contain some bad words it
automatically deletes them. 

It also spreads memes which it scrapes through reddit and its most popular 
subreddits like `r/memes` and `r/wholesomememes`. It also supplies with 
on-demand motivational quotes for someone who is feeling down.
